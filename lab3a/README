UCLA Fall 2016 CS111 Project 3a: File System Dump Dau-Po Yu 504451468

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Project 3 is expected to involve much more programming than any of the other projects.  You will design and implement programs to analyze file systems and diagnose corruption.  In part A, you will write a program to read the image of a file system, analyze it, and summarize its contents in several csv files. These csv files will be used in part B, where we will analyze the consistency of file system data structures and diagnose problems.

This solution does not output the same directory.csv as the sample solution
