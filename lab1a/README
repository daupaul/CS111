UCLA Fall 2016 CS111 Project 1a: I/O and IPC Dau-Po Yu 504451468

Introduction
In this assignment, we are required to write a program that
read single characters in noncanonical input mode, without echo.
Also, with the --shell option, it will execute a shell in a child
process, and we have to create another thread in parent to read 
from shell and write it to terminal. The purpose of this project 
is to make sure we understand multi-process application, 
inter-process communication, and exception handling.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Testing Methodolgy
Without the --shell option, the program will simply show what we 
type. With the --shell option, we can use shell command, such as
ls and exit. By using these commands, we can see that the shell 
and the pipes are working properly.
