UCLA Fall 2016 CS111 Project 0: Warm-Up Dau-Po Yu 504451468

------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction
In this assignment, we are required to write a program that
copies its standard input by read() from descriptor 0 to its
standard output by write() to descriptor 1. The purpose of
this project is to make sure we understand Linux, C code, and
Makefile.

------------------------------------------------------------

Testing Methodolgy
Test 1
Copy a existing input file to a non-existing output file. The
program should create the specified output file, and exit with
code 0 successfully.
Test 2
Copy a existing input file to a existing output file that has
a different content. The progarm should write and delete all
old data on the specified file, and exit with code 0
successfully.
Test 3
Both argument "--catch --segfault" and "--segfault --catch"
should lead to the program catching a segmentation fault using
signal() to register a SIGSEGV handler. The program should
exit with code 3 and print error message.

------------------------------------------------------------

This project includes:

lab0.c: C source code to copy its input file to output file

Makefile: Make the source code an executable, and check if
the program runs properly. Use make, make check, make clean,
and make dist.

README: This current file that provides a description of the
project.

backtrace.png, breakpoint.png: Screenshots show that we
understand how to debug using gdb.
