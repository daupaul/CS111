Introduction
In this assignment, we are required to write a multi-process 
telnet-like client and server.  We pass our input through a TCP 
socket and send it to server, which will forward it to a shell.
The purpose of this project is to make sure we understand 
multi-process application, basic network communication, and basic
encryption.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Testing Methodolgy
We use shell command, such as ls and exit. By using these commands,
we can see that the shell, the pipes, and the socket are working
properly. We can also use the --log option to see our record of data.
Moreover, we have the --encrypt option, so we can encrypt our messsage
while sending it through the socket.

----------------------------------------------------------------

This project includes:

client.c: C source code of client side.

server.c: C source code of server side.

my.key: my encryption key.

Makefile: Make the source code an executable. Use make, client, server, 
make clean, and make dist.

README: This current file that provides a description of the
project.
